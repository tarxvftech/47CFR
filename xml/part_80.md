<a name="80.312"></a>
#### § [80.312](#80.312) Priority of distress transmissions.

The distress call has absolute priority over all other transmissions. All stations which hear it must immediately cease any transmission capable of interfering with the distress traffic and must continue to listen on the frequency used for the emission of the distress call. This call must not be addressed to a particular station. Acknowledgement of receipt must not be given before the distress message which follows it is sent.

<a name="80.313"></a>
#### § [80.313](#80.313) Frequencies for use in distress.

The frequencies specified in the bands below are for use by mobile stations in distress. The conventional emission is shown. When a ship station cannot transmit on the designated frequency or the conventional emission, it may use any available frequency or emission. Frequencies for distress and safety calling using digital selective calling techniques are listed in § [80.359(b)](#80.359b). Distress and safety NB-DP frequencies are indicated by footnote 2 in § [80.361(b)](#80.361b).

The following table describes the calling frequencies in the 4000-27500 kHz band which are available for use by authorized ship stations equipped with crystal-controlled oscillators for A1A, J2A, J2B, or J2D radiotelegraphy. There are two series of frequencies for worldwide use and two series of frequencies for each geographic region. Ship stations with synthesized transmitters may operate on every full 100 Hz increment in the 0.5 kHz channel for the frequencies listed, except for 100 Hz above and below those designated for worldwide use. During normal business hours when not communicating on other frequencies, all U.S. coast radiotelegraph stations must monitor the worldwide frequencies and the initial calling frequencies for the region in which it is located. The specific frequencies which must be monitored by a coast station will vary with propagation conditions. The calling frequencies which are routinely monitored by specific coast stations can be determined by reference to the ITU publication entitled “List of Coast Stations.” Initial calls by ship stations must be made on the appropriate initial calling frequency first. Calls on the worldwide frequencies may be made only after calls on the appropriate initial calling frequency are unsuccessful.

If such maps are not published for the area in question, the next best topographic information must be used. The maps used must include the principal area to be served. U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps may be obtained from the Eastern Distribution Branch, U.S. Geological Survey, 1200 South Eads Street, Arlington, VA 22202, for maps of areas east of the Mississippi River, including Minnesota, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, and from the Western Distribution Branch, U.S. Geological Survey, Federal Center, Denver CO 80225, for maps of areas west of the Mississippi River, including Alaska, Hawaii, Louisiana, Guam and American Samoa. Sectional aeronautical charts are available from the Distribution Division, National Ocean Service, Riverdale, MD 20840.
<a name="80.757b"></a>
- (b) In lieu of maps, the average terrain elevation may be computer generated, using elevations from a 30 second point or better topographic data file such as those available for the U.S. Geological Survey's National Geographic Information Center or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Geophysical Data Center. In case of dispute maps will be used to determine the correct value.

<a name="80.759"></a>
#### § [80.759](#80.759) Average terrain elevation.
<a name="80.759a"></a>
- (a)(1) Draw radials from the antenna site for each 45 degrees of azimuth starting with true north. Any such radial which extends entirely over land from the antenna site to the point of + 17 dBu field strength need not be drawn.

<a name="80.761"></a>
#### § [80.761](#80.761) Conversion graphs.

The following graphs must be employed where conversion from one to the other of the indicated types of units is required.
<a name="80.761a"></a>
- (a)
Graph 1.
To convert effective radiated power in watts to dBk or to dBW, find the power in watts on the horizontal axis. Move vertically along the line representing the power to the diagonal line. Move horizontally from the diagonal to the right side to read dBW and to the left to read dBk.
<a name="80.761b"></a>
- (b)
Graph 2.
To convert microvolts across 50 ohms to received power in dBW, find the signal in microvolts on the horizontal axis. Move vertically to the diagonal line, then move right horizontally to read dBW.


<a name="80.761c"></a>
- (c)
Graph 3.
To convert received power in dBW to field intensity in dBu find the received power in dBW on the horizontal axis. Move vertically to the diagonal line, then move right horizontally to read dBu.

<a name="80.763"></a>
#### § [80.763](#80.763) Effective antenna height.

The effective height of the antenna is the vertical distance between the center of the radiating system above the mean sea level and the average terrain elevation.

<a name="80.765"></a>
#### § [80.765](#80.765) Effective radiated power.

Effective radiated power is used in computing the service area contour. The effective radiated power is derived from the transmitter output power, loss in the transmission system including duplexers, cavities, circulators, switches and filters, and the gain relative to a half-wave dipole of the antenna system.

<a name="80.767"></a>
#### § [80.767](#80.767) Propagation curve.

The propagation graph, § [80.767](#80.767) Graph 1, must be used in computing the service area contour. The graph provides data for field strengths in dBu for an effective radiated power of 1 kW, over sea water, fresh water or land (smooth earth); transmitting antena heights of 4,800, 3,200, 1,600, 800, 400, 200, and 100 feet; based on a receiving antenna height of 9 meters (30 feet), for the 156-162 MHz band. The use of this is described in this section.
<a name="80.767a"></a>
- (a) Calculate the effective radiated power of the coast station, Ps in dB referred to 1 kW (dBk), as follows:





where,

Pt = Transmitter output power in dB referred to 1 kW: Transmitter output power in watts is converted to dBk by Pt = 10 [log10 (Power in watts)]−30. Also see § [80.761](#80.761) Graph 1 for a conversion graph.

G = Antenna gain in dB referred to a standard half-wave dipole, in the direction of each plotted radial, and

L = Line losses between the transmitter and the antenna, in dB.


Notes:

1. To determine field strengths where the distance is known, for effective radiated powers other than 1kW (0 dBk): Enter the graph from the “statute miles” scale at the known distance, read up to intersection with the curve for the antenna height, read left to the “dBu for 1 kW radiated” scale and note the referenced field strength (Fe). The value of the actual field strength (F) in dBu will be F = Fe + Ps where Ps is the effective radiated power calculated above.

2. To determine distance, where the actual field strength is specified, for effective radiated powers other than 0 dBk: The value of the field referenced strength will be Fe = F−Ps in dBu. Enter the graph, from the “dBu for 1 kW radiated” scale at the corrected value of Fe, read right to intersection with the antenna height, read down to “statute miles” scale.
<a name="80.767b"></a>
- (b) Determine the antenna height. For antenna heights between the heights for which this graph is drawn, use linear interpolation; assume linear height-gain for antennas higher than 4,800 feet.
<a name="80.767c"></a>
- (c) For receiver antenna heights lower than 9 meters (30 feet), assume that the field strength is the same as at 9 meters (30 feet).
<a name="80.767d"></a>
- (d) Assume that propagation over fresh water or over land is the same as that over sea water.

<a name="80.769"></a>
#### § [80.769](#80.769) Shadow loss.

Where the transmission path is obstructed the received signal must be adjusted to include shadow loss. Attenuation due to shadowing must be taken from § [80.769](#80.769) Graph 1, as follows:
<a name="80.769a"></a>
- (a) Inspect the map(s) to determine if a hill(s) obstructs an imaginary line of sight (dashed line on illustrative profiles of § [80.769](#80.769) Graph 1 from the average terrain elevation at the coast station antenna to the water level at the ship location. If average terrain elevation exceeds the actual ground elevation at the antenna site, the latter elevation must be used as the average terrain elevation.
<a name="80.769b"></a>
- (b) If a hill appears to obstruct the radio path, plot the antenna site elevation, the obstruction elevation and the height of the ship station on rectangular coordinate paper using elevation above mean sea level as the vertical scale and distance in statute miles as the horizontal scale. Then draw a straight line between the antenna and the ship.
<a name="80.769c"></a>
- (c) If a hill obstructs the imaginary line of sight, determine its height (H) above the imaginary line and its distance (D) from either the coast or ship station, whichever is nearer, as illustrated by examples “A” and “B” on Graph 1.
<a name="80.769d"></a>
- (d) Read the shadow loss from this Graph 1 and subtract that loss from the computed received signal.
<a name="80.769e"></a>
- (e) Where more than one hill obstructs the transmission path, determine the height and position of a single equivalent hill, as illustrated by example “C” on this graph. Read the shadow loss from this graph for the equivalent hill.

<a name="80.771"></a>
#### § [80.771](#80.771) Method of computing coverage.

<a name="80.771a"></a>
- (a) Determine the effective antenna height above mean sea level according to the procedures in §§ [80.757](#80.757)-[80.761](#80.761).
<a name="80.771b"></a>
- (b) Determine the effective radiated power according to § [80,765](#80,765). Determine for each radial the distance from the antenna site to the + 17 dBu point of field strength using procedures of §§ [80.765](#80.765) and [80.767](#80.767).
<a name="80.771c"></a>
- (c) Plot on a suitable map each point of + 17 dBu field strength for all radials and draw the contour by connecting the adjacent points by a smooth curve.

### Operating Procedures for Distress and Safety Communications

<a name="80.1109"></a>
#### § [80.1109](#80.1109) Distress, urgency, and safety communications.
<a name="80.1109a"></a>
- (a) Distress traffic consists of all messages relating to the immediate assistance required by the ship in distress, including search and rescue communications and on-scene communications. Distress traffic must as far as possible be on the frequencies contained in § [80.1077](#80.1077).
<a name="80.1109b"></a>
- (b) Urgency and safety communications include: navigational and meteorological warnings and urgent information; ship-to-ship safety navigation communications; ship reporting communications; support communications for search and rescue operations; other urgency and safety messages and communications relating to the navigation, movements and needs of ships and weather observation messages destined for an official meteorological service.
<a name="80.1109c"></a>
- (c) Intership navigation safety communications are those VHF radiotelephone communications conducted between ships for the purpose of contributing to the safe movement of ships. The frequency 156.650 MHz is used for intership navigation safety communications (see § [80.1077](#80.1077)).

<a name="80.1111"></a>
#### § [80.1111](#80.1111) Distress alerting.
<a name="80.1111a"></a>
- (a) The transmission of a distress alert indicates that a mobile unit or person is in distress and requires immediate assistance. The distress alert is a digital selective call using a distress call format in bands used for terrestrial radiocommunication or a distress message format, which is relayed through space stations.
<a name="80.1111b"></a>
- (b) The distress alert must be sent through a satellite either with absolute priority in general communication channels or on exclusive distress and safety frequencies or, alternatively, on the distress and safety frequencies in the MF, HF, and VHF bands using digital selective calling.
<a name="80.1111c"></a>
- (c) The distress alert must be sent only on the authority of the person responsible for the ship, aircraft or other vehicle carrying the mobile station or the mobile earth station.
<a name="80.1111d"></a>
- (d) All stations which receive a distress alert transmitted by digital selective calling must immediately cease any transmission capable of interfering with distress traffic and must continue watch on the digital selective call distress calling channel until the call has been acknowledged to determine if a coast station acknowledges the call using digital selective calling. Additionally, the station receiving the distress alert must set watch on the associated distress traffic frequency for five minutes to determine if distress traffic takes place. The ship can acknowledge the call using voice or narrowband direct printing as appropriate on this channel to the ship or to the rescue authority.

[57 FR 9065, Mar. 16, 1992, as amended at 68 FR 46980, Aug. 7, 2003]

<a name="80.1113"></a>
#### § [80.1113](#80.1113) Transmission of a distress alert.
<a name="80.1113a"></a>
- (a) The distress alert must identify the station in distress and its position. The distress alert may also contain information regarding the nature of the distress, the type of assistance required, the course and speed of the mobile unit, the time that this information was recorded and any other information which might facilitate rescue.
<a name="80.1113b"></a>
- (b) The format of distress calls and distress messages must be in accordance with ITU-R M.493-13 and ITU-R M.541-9 (both incorporated by reference,
see		<a name="80.7"></a>
§ [80.7](#80.7)), as specified in § [80.1101](#80.1101).
<a name="80.7c"></a>
- (c) Ship-to-shore distress alerts are used to alert Rescue Coordination Centers via coast stations or coast earth stations that a ship is in distress. These alerts are based on the use of transmissions via satellites (from a ship earth station or a satellite EPIRB) and terrestrial services (from ship stations and EPIRBs).
<a name="80.7d"></a>
- (d) Ship-to-ship distress alerts are used to alert other ships in the vicinity of the ship in distress and are based on the use of digital selective calling in the VHF and MF bands. The HF bands should not be used to notify ships in the vicinity unless no response is received within five minutes on VHF or MF.
<a name="80.7e"></a>
- (e) Shore-to-ship distress alert relays are used by a station or Rescue Coordination Center to relay information about a ship in distress to, as appropriate, all ships, a selected group of ships, or a specific ship by satellite and/or terrestrial means. The distress alert relay must contain the identification of the mobile unit in distress, its position and all other information which might facilitate rescue.

[57 FR 9065, Mar. 16, 1992, as amended at 68 FR 46980, Aug. 7, 2003; 73 FR 4491, Jan. 25, 2008; 76 FR 67617, Nov. 2, 2011]

<a name="80.1114"></a>
#### § [80.1114](#80.1114) False distress alerts.

The provisions of §§ [80.334](#80.334) and [80.335](#80.335) apply to false distress alerts.

[68 FR 46980, Aug. 7, 2003]

<a name="80.1115"></a>
#### § [80.1115](#80.1115) Transmission of a distress alert by a station not itself in distress.
<a name="80.1115a"></a>
- (a) A station in the mobile or mobile-satellite service which learns that a mobile unit is in distress must initiate and transmit a distress alert relay in any of the following cases:
<a name="80.1115a1"></a>
  - (1) When the mobile unit in distress is not itself in a position to transmit the distress alert; or
<a name="80.1115a2"></a>
  - (2) When the master or person responsible for the mobile unit not in distress or the person responsible for the land station determines that further help is necessary.
<a name="80.1115b"></a>
- (b) A station transmitting a distress alert relay in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section or § [80.1121(c)](#80.1121c) must indicate that it is not itself in distress.

<a name="80.1117"></a>
#### § [80.1117](#80.1117) Procedure for receipt and acknowledgement of distress alerts.
<a name="80.1117a"></a>
- (a) Normally, distress calls received using digital selective calling are only acknowledged using a DSC acknowledgement by a coast station. Ships should delay any acknowledgement in order to give sufficient time for a coast station to acknowledge the call. In cases where no acknowledgement has been heard and no distress traffic has been heard, the ship should transmit a distress alert relay to the coast station. Upon advice from the Rescue Coordination Center, the ship may transmit a DSC acknowledgement call to stop it from being repeated. Acknowledgement by digital selective calling of receipt of a distress alert in the terrestrial services must comply with ITU-R M.541-9 (incorporated by reference,
see		<a name="80.7"></a>
§ [80.7](#80.7)).
<a name="80.7b"></a>
- (b) Acknowledgement through a satellite of receipt of a distress alert from a ship earth station must be sent immediately (see § [80.1119](#80.1119)).
<a name="80.7c"></a>
- (c) Acknowledgement by radiotelephony of receipt of a distress alert from a ship station or a ship earth station must be given in the following form:

[57 FR 9065, Mar. 16, 1992, as amended at 68 FR 46980, Aug. 7, 2003; 73 FR 4491, Jan. 25, 2008; 76 FR 67618, Nov. 2, 2011]

<a name="80.1119"></a>
#### § [80.1119](#80.1119) Receipt and acknowledgement of distress alerts by coast stations and coast earth stations.
<a name="80.1119a"></a>
- (a) Coast stations that receive a distress alert should defer acknowledgement for a short interval so that receipt may be acknowledged by a Rescue Coordination Center. Where an acknowledgement is not forthcoming within 3 minutes, the coast station in receipt of distress alerts must ensure that they are routed to a Rescue Coordination Center as soon as possible. Coast stations must provide assistance for distress communications when requested to do so by the U.S. Coast Guard. (This subpart does not specify any radio watches for coast stations.)
<a name="80.1119b"></a>
