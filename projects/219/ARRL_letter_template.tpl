## AMTS Station Request

Per 47 CFR 97.303(l)(4) and 47 CFR 97.303(l)(5) I request the list of
the AMTS coast stations that have notified you of their operations in
the 219-220MHz band as they are required by their authorization to do
under 47 CFR 80.215(b), and their locations, so that I may comply with
the operating restrictions in 97.303(l).

## AMTS Operation Notification

In addition, per 47 CFR 97.303(l)(3) I am notifying you of my intention
to operate in the 219-220 MHz secondary band in a little over 30 days. 
The details required under that section for my station are as follows:
