# 47CFR

This is a repository containing the text of Title 47 (Telecommunications) of the US Code of Federal Regulations.

XML is pulled from the eCFR api, see the interactive docs:
```
https://www.ecfr.gov/developers/documentation/api/v1#/Versioner%20Service/get_api_versioner_v1_full__date__title__title__xml
```

[Cornell's CFR reference](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47) is
much nicer to browse and read through than the XML, but it is not as
easy to suggest edits with the XML or by copying and pasting. Similarly
it's difficult to see all of a Part on one page.

Which brings this repo: provide readable, writable, text versions of
the regulations in a format that developers and others can edit while
remaining readable during and after editing, while gaining the power of
standard version control tools such as Git and Github.

Proposals for changes should go through the Pull Request interface,
and discussions around a set of changes should stick to that Pull Request.

## Projects: The Haunted VHF Band 219-220 MHz
The first reason to make and use this repo is to propose changes to Part
80 and Part 97 to make the 219-220 MHz ham band usable for Amateurs in
the United States again.

This effort is being lead by [Open Research Institute](https://www.openresearch.institute/getting-started/).

Please see the following for background on the 219 band effort - first an introductory video: 

[The Haunted VHF Band 219-220 MHZ- 11/01/2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6ds6RBufHI)

and then the first joint ORI/IEEE workshop discussing options:
