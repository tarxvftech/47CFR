This is a repository containing the text of Title 47 (Telecommunications) of the US Code of Federal Regulations.


## Projects: The Haunted VHF Band 219-220 MHz
The first reason to make and use this repo is to propose changes to Part 80 and Part 97 to make the 219-220 MHz ham band usable for Amateurs in the United States again.

This effort is being lead by [Open Research Institute](https://www.openresearch.institute/getting-started/).

Please see the following for background on the 219 band effort - first an introductory video: 

[The Haunted VHF Band 219-220 MHZ- 11/01/2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6ds6RBufHI)

and then the first joint ORI/IEEE workshop discussing options:

The next 219 MHz workshop is tentatively scheduled for the end of November 2024.
